- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript

### What I learned

WIth this i've started retreving data from JSON file. i think there are many other parts of it whicha are gonna come, but that's a start, in this one i didn't know where to start, so i need to watch a tutorial.

that tutorial is very helpful, that guy knows that a lot of total beginners are watching this, he explained very simply step-by-step.

watching him made me realize that responsiveness can be a lot more smoother than i was doing, i had to use his style of html classes, to get to know js better, so with that i saw his responsiveness, but even after spending a day in trying to achive that even after copying some his styles it didn't work.

then writing the js is very understandable by watching him, i know i can write similar code for my next projects by seeing js file of this project.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
